# Overview
Farmio is a B2B food supplier leveraging technology to streamline the entire delivery ecosystemâ€”from order placement to last-mile delivery. As their customer base expanded, the complexity of managing daily deliveries grew exponentially.  

**Challenge**  
Route planners were drowning in time-consuming manual processes, struggling to efficiently manage driver loads and delivery planning. The existing workflow was fragmented, repetitive, and increasingly unsustainable.

**Project Goals**
- Streamline logistics operations
- Reduce repetitive workload
- Improve operational efficiency
- Create a scalable routing solution

**Key Metrics**
- Initial Productivity Improvement: 83%
- Timeline: Q2 2024 - Q4 2024
- Platform: Web Application

**Team**
- Role: Lead Designer
- Composition: Designer, Software Engineer, CTO

**Skills Acquired**
- User research
- Complex UI and interaction
- Deconstructing complexity
- Interaction cost analysis


# Design Approach
Although this project was iterative, the typical process of each iteration was as follows:

# Iteration 1: Digitizing Delivery Grouping

**Previous Workflow**
- Manually copied order data to Google Sheets
- Accumulated and organized deliveries externally
- Exported to drivers through multiple steps

**Solution**
- Implemented postal code-based order grouping
- Enabled special delivery request capabilities

**Outcome**  
Instant delivery export, but limited initial impact

# Iteration 2: Multi-Driver Delivery Optimization

**Challenges**  
- Difficulty assigning drivers with specific delivery quotas
- Manual, time-consuming delivery assignment
- Inability to handle increasingly complex delivery distributions

**Solution**
- Developed multi-driver delivery feature
- Introduced drag-and-drop interface for delivery sequencing
- Allowed customized driver route assignments

# Iteration 3: Route Visualization and Switching

**Challenges**
- Inefficient address switching process
- Lack of route proximity visibility
- Constant manual map referencing

**Solution**
- Implemented kanban-style route management
- Integrated map visualization with postal code markers
- Enabled quick route and sequence rearrangement

**Outcome**  
Reduced route planning time from 1.5 hours to 45 minutes

# Iteration 4: Preset Routes and Advanced Address Management

**Challenges**
- Growing delivery complexity making previous solution is not time efficient
- When managing multiple customers per postal code, user are struggling because the visual marker in the map is overlapping on top of each other

**Solutions**
- Created preset routes adaptable to different drivers
- Developed tooltip and action system for overlapping addresses
- Simplified ad-hoc driver and address changes

**Outcome**  
Dramatically reduced route planning time from 3 hours to 30 minutes **(83% reduce in time taken)**

# Project Impact

**Quantitative Achievements**
- 83% reduction in route planning time
- Scalable system that's projected able to handle a thousand of addresses at a time
- Simplified complex logistics workflow

**Qualitative Insights**
- Empowered users through intuitive design
- Demonstrated adaptability in solving evolving operational challenges
- Prioritized user experience in complex system design

# Key Learnings

1. Solution design must evolve with operational scale
2. Deep user understanding beat assumptions
3. Iterative approach is crucial in complex system design
