# Company Context

Farmio is a B2B food supplier leveraging technology to streamline the entire delivery ecosystem—from order placement to last-mile delivery. As their customer base expanded, the complexity of managing daily deliveries grew exponentially.

# Project Overview

**Challenge**
Route planners were drowning in time-consuming manual processes, struggling to efficiently manage driver loads and delivery planning. The existing workflow was fragmented, repetitive, and increasingly unsustainable.

**Project Goals**
- Streamline logistics operations
- Reduce repetitive workload
- Improve operational efficiency
- Create a scalable routing solution

**Key Metrics**
- Initial Productivity Improvement: 83%
- Timeline: Q2 2024 - Q4 2024
- Platform: Web Application

**Project Team**
- Role: Lead Designer
- Composition: Designer, Software Engineer, CTO

# Design Approach

**Methodology**
1. **Problem Identification**
   - Conducted user research through direct observation
   - Performed comparative analysis
   - Deeply understood user pain points

2. **Design Process**
   - Framed complex problems
   - Generated design ideas
   - Developed UI and interaction design
   - Collaborated closely with engineering team

3. **Development & Testing**
   - Facilitated design handover
   - Iterated based on development constraints
   - Conducted feedback sessions
   - Performed usability testing

# Iteration 1: Digitizing Delivery Grouping

**Previous Workflow**
- Manually copied order data to Google Sheets
- Accumulated and organized deliveries externally
- Exported to drivers through multiple steps

**Solution**
- Implemented postal code-based order grouping
- Enabled special delivery request capabilities
- Created flexible logistics data export mechanism

**Outcome**:
Instant delivery export, but limited initial impact

# Iteration 2: Multi-Driver Delivery Optimization

**Challenges**
- Difficulty assigning drivers with specific delivery quotas
- Manual, time-consuming delivery assignment
- Inability to handle increasingly complex delivery distributions

**Solution**
- Developed multi-driver delivery feature
- Introduced drag-and-drop interface for delivery sequencing
- Allowed customized driver route assignments

**New Workflow**
Create route → Select addresses → Arrange delivery sequence → Preview → Export

# Iteration 3: Route Visualization and Switching

**Challenges**
- Inefficient address switching process
- Lack of route proximity visibility
- Constant manual map referencing

**Solution**
- Implemented kanban-style route management
- Integrated map visualization with postal code markers
- Enabled quick route and sequence rearrangement

**Outcome**: 
Reduced route planning time from 1.5 hours to 45 minutes

# Iteration 4: Preset Routes and Advanced Address Management

**Challenges**
- Growing delivery complexity
- Difficulty managing multiple customers per postal code
- Time-consuming route reassignments

**Solutions**
- Created preset routes adaptable to different drivers
- Developed tooltip and action system for overlapping addresses
- Simplified ad-hoc driver and address changes

**Outcome**: 
Dramatically reduced route planning time from 3 hours to 30 minutes (83% improvement)
