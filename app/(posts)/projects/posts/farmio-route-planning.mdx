# Company Overview

Farmio is a B2B food supplier enabled by tech it builds that spans from ordering process up to last mile delivery.

# Project Overview

As the customer base grow, Farmio started to handle numerous deliveries every day. Route planner need to handle a lot of time requests while managing driver loads during delivery planning.

In this project, we go all the way from zero to scalable feature through iterative approach. We tried to tailor solution based on real feedback rather than just assumptions.

The goal was to streamline logistics, reduce repetitive workload, and improve operational efficiency for suppliers. We saw remarkably 83% better productivity for route planner after last iteration.

In this project: you'll be able to asses these skills from me:

- System thinking
- Complex interface simplification
- Navigate ambiguous project
- 0 -> 1 projects

# Iteration 1: Digitizing Delivery Group

### Problem

Previously, supplier are using google sheet to arrange deliveries.

Repetitive manual workload of bringing information from system to external source then do the work outside become the challenge in this case.

Previous workflow:

Copy order data from system to google sheets → Accumulate data → Organize delivery → Export to driver → done

### Solution

- Implemented postal code-based order grouping
- Enabled special delivery request capabilities
- Created flexible logistics data export mechanism

New workflow:

Export logistics data → done

### Outcome

Instant delivery export, but no measurable impact.

# Iteration 2: Multi-driver delivery and sequencing

### Problem

With growing numbers of delivery, the system lacks a way for Suppliers to assign drivers with a specified number of deliveries per day.

Challenges:

- Difficulty in assigning drivers with different tasks while taking into account a set number of deliveries per day.
- Manual effort required to assign deliveries to drivers.
- Can no longer assume that one driver can cope with whole batch of delivery

Previous workflow:

Export pdf → Edit using external app to give remarks and sequence → export to driver - repeat every day

### Solution

- Added multi-driver delivery feature
- One driver can be assigned to multiple addresses with customized sequence using drag-n-drop interaction

New workflow:
Create route → choose addresses to include → arrange delivery sequence → preview → export

It might seems that we add more process to the solution, but actually we decrease repetitiveness.

### Outcome

Helps user make customizable driver route but no measurable impact.

# Iteration 3: Flexible route switching with map visualization

### Problem

Current system ability only allows creation of route, assign address to driver, and sequence the delivery. With scaled number of delivery, this become insufficient.

Challenges:

- Address can be switched between route quite often due to delivery requests, and the existing flow is inefficient
- No visibility over the proximity of route addresses, urging the needs to open new tab for google maps to make decision

Previous workflow:

Review address → copy the address → paste into google maps → copy 2nd address → paste to google maps → get visualization of distance → not efficient? → switch route or sequence → repeat → done

### Solution

- Utilized kanban board for more advanced route switching and sequencing
- Provide map as visualization to planned route with marker on each postal code

New workflow:

See Address → See indicator on maps → rearrange route or sequence → done

### Outcome

Versatile route switching with immediate visualization, reducing 50% time taken from 1.5 hours to just 45 minutes.

# Iteration 4: Preset Route and Address Visualization

In this particular iteration, problem (1) were handled by my design peer as I was working on another project.

### Problems

As the customer base grows, the complexities of delivery is also growing causing time taken to plan route increases to be 3 hours managing a couple hundreds of delivery.

1. System can’t accommodate adhoc changes of driver and delivery address
2. As one postal code may have multiple customers, it’s overlapping on top of each other and becomes difficult to manage.

Previous workflow

1. Change in driver → re assign routes to new driver → when driver comes back or replaced → re assign
2. Click one marker → Position on board identified → Identify nearest location/group → bring that nearest group board to be side-to-side with unassigned lane → move the location to the correct lane → repeat → decide sequence

  width={992} height={621}
/>

### Solutions

1. Provide preset routes that can be assigned to any driver without changing the route
2. Provide tooltip and actions to move overlapping address

New workflow

1. Create a few preset routes depending on the need → assign initial driver → when adhoc changes needed only for certain day, change driver or address on “assigned address”
2. Identify → click → click move → fill move details → done

### Outcome

Significantly reduce time taken for route planning from 3 hours to 30 minutes, a decrease of 83%.

# Impact & Learnings

### Impact

- Over the course of time, the user feels empowered and saw notable decrease in time taken to do their job by 83% after latest iteration.
- The design also able to manage scale of route with a thousand of addresses

### Learnings

- As the sales and operations scale, the problem are evolving thus the solution need to adapt.
- Understanding user and their problems is just as important as the solution.
- In the field, the driver faces multiple problems during delivery, and one thing the back office can do is to help suggest the best route sequence.
