# Overview

Farmio is a B2B food supply chain platform that connects food suppliers and buyers, managing everything from ordering to payment processing. But there was a critical pain point: payment reconciliation was a nightmare.

Imagine spending half a day—roughly 4 hours—manually tracking payments in Excel, wrestling with irregular payment cycles, and drowning in spreadsheet chaos. This was the daily reality for Farmio's finance team.


**Project Goals**
- Streamline payment and financial operational
- Ensure accurate accounting and financial record
- Reduce invoice amount dispute

**Key Metrics**
- Initial Productivity Improvement: 80%
- Timeline: Q2 2024 - Q4 2024
- Platform: Web Application

**Team**
- Role: Lead Designer
- Composition: Designer, Software Engineer, CTO

**Skills Acquired**
- System thinking
- Rapid prototyping
- Accounting ledger

# The Initial Challenge

With over 100 recurring buyers and no standardized payment cycle, Farmio faced a complex problem:
- Customer paid irregularly
- Tracking payments was time-consuming
- Manual reconciliation led to constant discrepancies


# First Version: The Broken Model

The initial payment model quickly revealed its limitations:
- Repetitive, manual work dominated the process
- Billing generation was a multi-step, error-prone ordeal
- Finance team relied more on Google Sheets than the platform

**Result:** The platform was essentially unused, with most work happening outside the system.

# Second Version: Basic Abilities

We focused on critical capabilities that were previously missing:


- Give ability to configure own payment terms
- Give ability to generate billing for easier chasing
- Give ability to settle multiple invoices at once

Despite improvements, challenges persisted:
- Only "export billing" was frequently used
- Customers demanded customized billing periods
- Payment settling remained largely manual

# Third Version: Flexible Reconciliation

Our goal was to create a more intelligent, less repetitive payment reconciliation feature:

Key Improvements:
- Customized billing generation
- Automated invoice clearing
- Flexible payment options for individual or grouped invoices

Logic Evolution:
- Prioritize specific invoice payments
- Automatically clear oldest invoices first
- Handle unspecified payments properly
- Generate credit notes when no invoice left to paid

# Fourth Version: Bank Reconciliation

As our customer base grew, we needed an even more automated solution and can't rely solely to previous logic. Our approach:

**Bank Statement Processing:**
- Upload raw bank statements
- Automatically translate to a structured table
- Identify sender and match to companies or invoicesthat exist in Farmio platform
- Create rules for processing entries

**Smart Handling:**
- Highlight entries exceeding outstanding amounts
- Allow manual intervention for complex scenarios
- Provide clear pathways for reconciliation

The third iteration and fourth now co-exist and covers different use case, while waiting for automated payment link integration to come.

# Impact and Results

**Time Saved:**
- Initial process: 4 hours of manual work
- After third iteration: 50% reduction in invoice management time
- After fourth iteration: Reconciliation completed in just 30 minutes, 87.5% time saved compared to the initial model

> "The new payment feature is really useful and easy to use. I don't need to spend time anymore finding and second-guessing which invoice I need to mark as paid."

# Key Learnings

1. **Continuous evolution**: Products are never finished—they grow and adapt with user needs.
2. **Beyond design**: Success requires deep understanding of underlying systems and logic.
3. **User-centricity**: Stay close to users, but remain a design gatekeeper.
4. **Prototype first**: Iterate extensively in design to minimize development complications.
