# Overview

Farmio is a B2B food supply chain platform that connects food suppliers and buyers, managing everything from ordering to payment processing. But there was a critical pain point: payment reconciliation was a nightmare.

Imagine spending half a day—roughly 4 hours—manually tracking payments in Excel, wrestling with irregular payment cycles, and drowning in spreadsheet chaos. This was the daily reality for Farmio's finance team.

# The Initial Challenge

With over 100 recurring buyers and no standardized payment cycle, Farmio faced a complex problem:
- Customers paid at their convenience
- Tracking payments was time-consuming
- Manual reconciliation led to constant discrepancies


# First Version: The Broken Model

The initial payment model quickly revealed its limitations:
- Repetitive, manual work dominated the process
- Billing generation was a multi-step, error-prone ordeal
- Finance team relied more on Google Sheets than the platform

**Result**: The platform was essentially unused, with most work happening outside the system.

# Second Version: Unlocking Potential

We focused on critical capabilities that were previously missing:

<Cards>
<Card>Minimum configuration of payment terms → Give ability to configure own payment terms</Card>
<Card>No ability to generate billing to chase customers → Give ability to generate billing for easier chasing</Card>
<Card>A lot of repetitive work to reconcile payment → Give ability to settle multiple invoices at once</Card>
</Cards>

Despite improvements, challenges persisted:
- Only "export billing" was frequently used
- Customers demanded customized billing periods
- Payment settling remained largely manual

# Third Version: Flexible Reconciliation

Our goal was to create a more intelligent, less repetitive payment reconciliation feature:

Key Improvements:
- Customized billing generation
- Automated invoice clearing
- Flexible payment options for individual or grouped invoices

Logic Evolution:
- Prioritize specific invoice payments
- Automatically clear oldest invoices first
- Handle unspecified payments intelligently
- Generate credit notes when appropriate

**Demonstration Features:**

# Fourth Version: Intelligent Bank Reconciliation

As our customer base grew, we needed an even more automated solution. Our approach:

**Bank Statement Processing:**
- Upload raw bank statements
- Automatically translate to a structured table
- Identify sender and match to companies
- Create rules for processing entries

**Intelligent Handling:**
- Highlight entries exceeding outstanding amounts
- Allow manual intervention for complex scenarios
- Provide clear pathways for reconciliation

# Impact and Results

**Time Saved:**
- Initial process: 4 hours of manual work
- After third iteration: 50% reduction in invoice management time
- After fourth iteration: Reconciliation completed in just 30 minutes

> "The new payment feature is really useful and easy to use. I don't need to spend time anymore finding and second-guessing which invoice I need to mark as paid."

# Key Learnings

1. **Continuous Evolution**: Products are never finished—they grow and adapt with user needs.
2. **Beyond UI/UX**: Success requires deep understanding of underlying systems and logic.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Stay close to users, but remain a design gatekeeper.
4. **Prototype First**: Iterate extensively in design to minimize development complications.
